Strengthening Mechanisms
    What happens when materials undergo elastic deformation?
    What happens when materials undergo plastic deformation?
        - Dislocation motion

    (1) Solid solution strengthening(Alloys)
        Impurity or solute atoms present in material which can slow down dislocations
            Related to bonding + atomic size
    (2) Strain hardening (Work hardening) 
        Work applied creates more dislocation (increase in dislocation density)
        Dislocations  blocked by other dislocations
        Relevant for metal processing methods including rolling, forging, stamping
        Can be performed at low(cold work) or high(hot work) temperatures
    (3) Precipitation strengthening
        Dislocations are bloced by precipitates
        Dislocations can pass through or bow around a precipitate

        Important for age hardening and other heat treatments
    (4) Grain boundary strengthening
        Hall-Petch equation:
            plot of function YS(sqrt(grain_radius)) 
            where smaller grains -> more grain boundaries -> dislocations pile-up at grain boundaries
        Annealing

Age-Hardening/Precipitation strengthening

    Consider a phase diagram example of Al - 2wt% Cu

    If alloy cooled slowly:
        expect formation of theta precipitates when cooled from alpha region
    to control/improve the strength of alloy:
        (1)Solution treatment
            heat alloy to single phase region (T_sol) which is only alpha
        (2)Quench from alpha region
            rapidly cool metal
            material is super saturated alpha(more than equilibrium)
            no theta precipitates
        (3)Age-Hardening
            heat materail for a specific temp and time(T_age, t_age)
            precipitates of theta form and grow (max amount of theta is given by lever rule)

            what about properties?
                plot of hardness vs log(time)

                optium size/distribution leads to peak aging
                "natural aging" -> age hardening at room temp

                
Other Annealing -> heat treatments
    possible effects
        dislocations relax and annihilate (recovery and recrystallization)
            reduced # of dislocations
            reduced yield strength
        new/different precipitates and phases can form
            in steels, Austenite->Ferrite+Cementite at 738C
            can increase or decrease strength/toughness
        grain size increases(see Hall-Petch)
        residual stresses can be relieved
            atoms can move to more favourable locations (diffusion)
