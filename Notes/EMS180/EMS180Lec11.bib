10/27
Load: L_f (defined as 1/L in book)
    fraction of time equipment is used for this part
    if equipment is used 50% of time -> L_f = 0.5
Write-off time: two
    cost of borrowing $
    time to pay off equipment
    often 5-10 years
Prodction rate n_dot (time derivative)
    # of parts/hour
C_3 = 1/n_dot * L_f * C_c/t_wo
C_4: Overhead Cost
    cost of owning manufacturing facility, paying for workers, electricity, etc.
    we will use C_ohdot = $100/hr
        C_4 = C_ohdot / ndot;
    Combine terms
        C = (m * C_m)/(1-f) + C_t/n * ceiling(n/nt) + 1/n_dot * [ (L_f * C_c/t_wo+C_ohdot) ]

    (2)plot(log(n_, C) applied to lego cost model
    (3)Case Study 14.2 from textbook (Aluminum connecting rod)
    (4) plot(Relative cost per component, Number of components)
        for project, just come up with cost

CLASS Activity
    manufacture flat-head screwdrivers such as the one shown in the image. The metal part of the screwdriver is made of steel and is a solid
    component with given dimensions

POLYMERS: Long chains of organic molecules
    Classifications
        (1) Polymer behavior
            Thermpolastics
                ex: Polyethylene, ABS
                structure: linear
                become soft/melt at high temp
                Recyclable
            Thermosets
                ex: Polyesters, Epoxies
                structure: rigid, cross-linked structure
                temperature behavior:
                    High melting point
                    little softening
                Higher strength + modulus
            Elastomers
                ex: Rubber
                High elasticity(can sustain large elastic strains)
                structure: Long chains of molecules that can coil and uncoil
                Material properties can be controlled by: 
                    cross-linking
                    vulcanization of rubber
                        add S?, which creates cross-links
        (2) Polymerization Mechanism
            covalently join monomers to each other

            need initiator to start reaction
                typically forms OH- from dissolution of H2O2
            reaction continues
                chains get longer
            reaction terminated by another OH- or another chain
            molecular weight (chain weight) determined by amount of initiator/terminator that is present
