Uncertainty analysis
    when we report an experimental result, we should report:
        x = x_bar +- U_x
        or
        Mu_x = x_bar +- U_x_bar
            where U_x = expanded uncertainty of x
            where U_x = expanded uncertainty of M_x
            In 95% of x, x = 5.0 +- 0.1  <-- this tolerance term is U_x
    
    For measurands that vary continuously, cannot measure their values exactly, i.e, there will always be
    uncertainty
